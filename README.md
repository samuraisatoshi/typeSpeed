## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Your Code, Your Practice** - Select any folder with source code to practice with real projects
- 🎯 **Smart Code Selection** - Intelligent snippet selection that focuses on actual code, not comments
- 🌈 **25+ Languages** - Support for JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Rust, Go, Ruby, and more
- 📊 **Real-time Metrics** - Track WPM, accuracy, and progress as you type
- 📈 **Statistics Tracking** - Monitor your improvement over time with detailed session history
- 🔒 **100% Private** - Runs entirely offline in your browser, no data collection
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Modern dark theme with syntax highlighting
- ⚡ **No Installation** - Just open the HTML file and start practicing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct Browser (Easiest)
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Select a folder with code files
4. Start typing!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typespeed.git
cd typespeed
open index.html  # macOS
# or
start index.html # Windows
# or
xdg-open index.html # Linux
```

### Option 2: Local Server (Avoids Browser Dialogs)
```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Select Your Code** - Click "Select Code Folder" and choose a directory with source files
2. **Start Typing** - Click "Start Typing" to begin with a random code snippet
3. **Type Away** - Follow the highlighted code, typing exactly as shown
4. **Track Progress** - Watch your WPM and accuracy in real-time
5. **View Stats** - Check the Statistics tab to see your improvement over time

### Pro Tips
- Leading spaces/tabs are auto-skipped - focus on the actual code
- Use "New Snippet" to get different code samples
- Sessions are saved locally for progress tracking
- Delete individual sessions or clear all to start fresh

## 🏗️ Architecture

TypeSpeed is built with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **SOLID principles**:

```
js/
├── domain/              # Core business logic
│   ├── TypingSession.js       # Session management
│   ├── CodeFileRepository.js  # File storage
│   ├── Statistics.js          # Performance tracking
│   └── CodeSnippetSelector.js # Smart code selection
├── application/         # Application services
│   ├── TypingApp.js          # Main orchestrator
│   └── UIController.js       # UI state management
└── infrastructure/      # Technical implementation
    └── InputHandler.js       # Keyboard input handling
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection** - Your code never leaves your computer
- **No Internet Required** - Works 100% offline
- **No Analytics** - Zero tracking or telemetry
- **Local Storage Only** - Statistics saved in browser localStorage
- **Open Source** - Inspect the code yourself
